# Fighter-game
This is a game that I am slowly working on

Ideas: 
Text based platformer(?) 
combat based upon dnd logic 
character customization cause why the fuck not 
the different customization will have special perk (think skyrim) 
do text based in the sense of like an array that is happening OR you have to randomly enter x or something to get around things like you are blind in a room(?) 
so a mix of "you entered combat will you fight or flee" and then if you flee you have to guess the exit pattern in an array(?) does that make sense (zork)
